        <p>The Union is one of the most popular study spots for students with 4 floors. The basement holds many open study spots and a food court for Panda Express, Subway, and Qdoba. On the 1st floor, it is usually busy, with open seating outside of the Sweetwaters and Panera Bread if you want a quick bite to eat. If you need a super quiet place to get some work done, there is quiet study lounge just for that by the entrance. Many students go to the 2nd floor in the IdeaHub. This room is great if you're studying with a group of people. The 3rd and 4th floors don't offer as many studying spots as many it holds office spaces, but there are a few seats if you like a quieter environment.</p>

        <p>The Shapiro Library, or more commonly known as the Ugli, is one of the most popular libraries on Central Campus. The Ugli has 4 floors of open study spaces, private rooms, computer labs, and a pleathora of charging spots. With a cafe situated at the entrance, you can grab a coffee or a snack when studying. The first and second floor tends to be busy, but you can usually find an open seat. The third floor is newly renovated and offers many comfortable seating. Make sure to come early as the third floor is the busiest floor and seats fill up very quickly. If you prefer quieter study spots, the 4th floor is for you. </p>
